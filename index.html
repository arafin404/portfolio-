			<h2 style="color:skyblue">The Hare And The Tortoise</h2>
			<p style="font-size:17px">
				The hare saw a tortoise when he was walking in the forest one day. The hare teased him for his slow movement. The tortoise became angry and proposed him to run a race.
				Under a big tree was the starting point of running. They called their friends to watch the race. The race began when the hare and tortoise stood side by side.
				The hare ran quickly. In a few minutes the hare was out of side. The tortoise was very far behind. So he wanted to have a nap. Soon je was asleep under a tree next to the path.
				On the other hand the tortoise walked steadily on and on. He didn’t stop. Soon he passed the sleeping hare. The hare slept for an hour. When he woke up he saw that the tortoise was near the finish line.
				The hare ran as fast as he could but it was too late. In the mean time the tortoise crossed the finish line and won the competition. Finally the tortoise said to the hare smilingly that slow but steady wins the race.

				There are many games in the world such as football. cricket, volleyball, tennis. badminton, kabadi etc. All games are not amusing and interesting. Of them football is my favorite game.
				Football is played between two teams. Each them consist of eleven players. There are a goalkeeper, two full backs, three half backs and five forward players.
				A referee conducts the game properly. There are two linesmen who help the referee. The ball is paced at the field. The game starts when the referee whistles. 
				Football is played between two teams by some particular rules. Only the goalkeeper can catch the ball. The game lasts for 90 minutes with a short interval. 
				Playing is a good form of exercise. It makes the players active and strong. It teaches the discipline and co-operation. It is a  foreign game but it is very popular in Bangladesh. Indeed it is the most popular game in the world.
